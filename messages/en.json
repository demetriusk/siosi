      "downturned-eyes": "Downturned eyes tilt slightly downward at the outer corners, giving them a soft and gentle appearance. With a bit of darker shadow angled upward, you can easily create a flattering, lifted effect.",
      "close-set-eyes": "Close-set eyes sit closer together, with less than one eye’s width of space between them. Using lighter tones on the inner corners and defining the outer edges helps open up the face beautifully.",
      "wide-set-eyes": "Wide-set eyes have a little extra space between them, giving a balanced and open expression. Looks that emphasize the center of the eyes — like smoky or halo styles — bring gorgeous harmony to this shape.",
      "deep-set-eyes": "Deep-set eyes rest slightly under the brow bone, creating a naturally defined crease. Highlighting the lids and blending softly in the crease helps make them pop and feel more open.",
      "protruding-eyes": "Protruding eyes have a charming, standout shape that makes them ideal for creative makeup play. With the right mix of shadows and highlights, you can create dreamy, multi-dimensional looks that truly shine."
